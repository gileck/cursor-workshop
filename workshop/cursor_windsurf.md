**AI Capabilities**

* **Windsurf** leverages a multi-model architecture tailored for different coding tasks—custom low-latency keystroke models for instant completions, proprietary retrieval systems for large codebases, and specialized planning models for high-level workflows.  It also supports cutting-edge models like GPT-4.1, Gemini 2.5 Pro and o4-mini, plus fill-in-the-middle (FIM) capabilities to handle complex edits seamlessly ([Latent.Space][1], [Windsurf][2]).
* **Cursor** uses a mix of purpose-built and frontier models (e.g., Claude 3.5 Sonnet) under the hood (“Frontier Intelligence”), combined with custom retrieval to index and query your entire codebase.  It offers SOC 2-certified privacy mode and local model options, ensuring your code never leaves your machine unless you choose to ([Cursor][3], [Cursor][4]).

**Agent Quality**

* **Windsurf’s Cascade** is a full-blown agentic workflow engine.  It can:

  * Perform multi-file, multi-step edits in one coherent “flow”
  * Remember key context via auto-generated **Memories** and **Rules**
  * Run and even auto-execute terminal commands (Turbo mode)
  * Auto-fix lint errors at no extra credit cost
  * Preview and deploy apps—all without leaving the IDE
    Cascade supports up to 20 tool calls per prompt and maintains real-time awareness of your actions ([Windsurf][2], [Windsurf][5]).

* **Cursor’s Agent mode** (in Composer) can complete end-to-end developer tasks while keeping you in the loop.  It:

  * Auto-gathers necessary files and context
  * Generates and applies code changes across multiple files
  * Writes and runs shell commands (with confirmation)
  * Detects lint errors and loops on fixes automatically
  * Provides a conversational chat interface tied directly to your codebase ([Cursor][4]).

**UI & Usability**

* **Windsurf** offers a clean, minimalist interface with agentic workflows enabled by default.  Code changes are written to disk before approval, giving you real-time feedback in your dev server, and you can iterate or revert through a built-in timeline ([DEV Community][7]).
* **Cursor** provides a “power-tool” UI: explicit inline diffs, many context-specific AI buttons (Fix with AI, Debug with AI, etc.), and more manual controls over what the AI touches.  Steeper learning curve but granular control for precision workflows ([DEV Community][7]).

**Pricing & Licensing**

* **Windsurf**

  * Free tier with monthly prompt credits and base features
  * Pro at **\$15/seat** (includes premium models, unlimited supercomplete, higher indexing limits)
  * Enterprise custom pricing (includes advanced analytics and on-prem support) ([DEV Community][7])
* **Cursor**

  * Free student tier
  * Pro at **\$20/seat**, with usage-based fees for certain features (e.g., bug-finder)
  * Enterprise custom pricing (SOC 2 certified, private model options) ([DEV Community][7])

**So, which should you choose?**

* **Beginner-friendly & flow-state focus** → **Windsurf**: simpler UI, agentic workflows by default, real-time feedback loop, lower entry price.
* **Power user & granular control** → **Cursor**: deep multi-model features, rich context management, advanced editor/terminal commands, commit-message and bug-finder extras.

Both tools are market-leading AI IDEs with robust agents and mature developer experiences; your choice depends on whether you value streamlined flow and simplicity (Windsurf) or extensive power features and fine-grained control (Cursor).
